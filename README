iFocus Printing
by James Kuch

Usage: 
-run run.bat or run (with console).bat
-enter fields from drop-down menus to select files
-press buttons to start printing.


Files:

ifocus.ps1:
-Finds the worksheet files selected by the user and opens/prints those files.
-Only useful on an iFocus computer with dropbox access to those worksheets.
-Pros: Marginally better than manually searching for every directory
-Cons: Any file system updates have to be fixed in the main script manually.

loadDialog.ps1
-links the xaml to the main powershell script.
-Not coded by me, found from: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PowerShell-GUI-dc224be6

GUI.xaml
-The interface code, or at least its formatting. The subjects are hardcoded in and act as
the basis for what all the other fields contain.

run.bat
-opens powershell and runs the script. Essentially this program's executable.

run (with console).bat
-does the same as the above but shows the console
-for debugging, but also may be required if the script is blocked due to security settings
